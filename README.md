    Run 3D-RISM single point calculation. This script is a wrapper around Amber
    rism3d.snglpnt program, designed to simplify calculations. It also computes
    pressure corrections to RISM solvation free energy.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    Solute options:
      Options related to a solute molecule. Calculation requires only pdb and
      prmtop files. If prmtop file is not present, script will try to create
      this file using antechamber and tleap. By default AM1-BCC charges and GAFF
      will be used.

      molec.pdb             Input solute file. Must be in pdb format acceptable by
                            Antechamber. Must have a .pdb extension.

                            solute.
      --scale_chg SCALE_CHG
                            Scale all solute by this value prmtop file [1.0].
      -c MOLCHARGE, --molcharge MOLCHARGE
                            Charge of the solute [0].
      --multiplicity MULTIPLICITY
                            Multiplicity of the solute [1].
      --minimize MINIMIZE   Minimize solute before performing 3D-RISM calculation
                            using either gradient descent (min) or RISM
                            minimization using sander (rism, not recommended). If
                            no keywords are provided minimization is not
                            performed.

    1D-RISM options:
      3D-RISM calculation requires xvv file (site-site susceptibilities) to run.
      If such file is not provided script can run a 1D-RISM to try to genrate
      it, but will asume that the solvent is pure water. Some of the 1D-RISM
      related options are in 3D-RISM group.

      -x XVV, --xvv XVV     Path to an existing xvv file. This will skip 1D-RISM
                            calculation and all related parameters will be
                            ignored. Solvent density as well as calculation
                            temeprature will be read from this file.
      --smodel SMODEL       Solvent model for 1D-RISM calculation available in
                            "$AMBERHOME/dat/rism1d/model/{smodel}.mdl" [SPC].
      --rism1d RISM1D       Type of 1D-RISM theory. Only DRISM has been

                            should be an integer) or a list of them for sequential
                            convergence. For 1D-RISM calculation only last closure
                            will be used [PSE3].

                            preformed. If xvv file was provided, this option will
                            be used only for naming directory [298.15].
      --clean_up CLEAN_UP   How should auxiliary files be treated: 0 - delete
                            nothing; 1 - delete some [default]; 2 - delete all but
                            input, results, and log.

Notes
-----
The script has been tested only on Ubuntu, but it should work on most Linux distributions and on Mac OS X. To make it Windows-friendly one would probably need to change the names of executable programs and add them to the PATH.
